  "response": "Based on the provided context, GRPO stands for **Group Relative Policy Optimization**. It is a method used in reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce training costs by eliminating the need for a separate critic model. Instead, it estimates the baseline from group scores by sampling multiple outputs from the old policy and optimizing the policy model accordingly.\n\n<answer>GRPO stands for Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning technique that reduces training costs by using group scores instead of a critic model to estimate baselines.</answer>",

Specifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · · , 𝑜𝐺} from the old policy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:",
